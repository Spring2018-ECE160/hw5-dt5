## Question 2

(K&R Exercise 5-3) Write a pointer version of the function <code>strcat</code> that we showed in Chapter 2: <code>strcat(s,t)</code> copies the string to to the end of s. Verify that your function works with at least 3 examples.

Compile Steps:
`make`  
Output:
```
./question2 
"Hello, " + "World" = "Hello, World"
"Tom" + "&Jerry" = "Tom&Jerry"
"George " + "Orwell" = "George Orwell"
```
